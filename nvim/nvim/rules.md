* Keep comments minimal
* Add key maps to quickly get to your configuration file and reload it
* Only add things when you actually notice something you don't like about the defaults
* For plugins, re-assess the availabnle options and **read the docs**
* If it's quick, do it staight away
* Otherwise just make a note 
* Regularly make time to hone your configuration to suit you perfectly
